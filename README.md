An *experimental* Fediverse server for microblogging/"toots". Not fully functional yet -
we're still working towards a 1.0!

Key features:

- Multiple domain support
- Multiple identities per user (and can be shared between users)
- Desktop, mobile and PWA-compatible web UI (with minimal JavaScript)
- Easy deployment (web worker, background worker, and one database)
