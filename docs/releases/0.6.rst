Upgrade Notes
-------------

Signed Cookie Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of version 0.6, TakahÄ“ uses signed cookies for sessions rather than a
database table. As part of this change, when you upgrade, all users will be
signed out, but no data will be lost - they just need to sign in again.


Storage Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use Google Cloud for storage, the URI format has changed - before it was
``gcs://bucketname``, and now it is ``gs:///bucketname``.


Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new database migrations, but for once, they are not fully
backwards-compatible, as we've deleted the unneeded ``stator_errors`` table.

To apply these migrations, you should:

* Stop all Stator processes (it's fine to leave webservers going)
* Apply the migrations
* Start new Stator processes
