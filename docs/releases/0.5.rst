*Released: 2022/12/04*

This release brings Takahē to an almost full implementation of the underlying
ActivityPub protocol, with only custom emoji and manual follower approval as
high-level features we are yet to implement.

Our goal now is to reach an initial "island of stability", where we ensure
good test coverage and compatibility testing with a suite of other ActivityPub
servers before we continue down adding main features (though there's still
plenty of smaller features we'll add).

This release includes:

* Image uploading for posts, with image descriptions
* Hashtag parsing, search and timeline pages
* RSS feeds for users' public posts
* Collapsing of related notifications into one
* Automatic refetching and cleaning for Identities (profiles) and internal message buffers
* Mastodon now understands Takahē profile and post URLs in its search box
* Fixes to search, activitypub parsing, upload naming, email and media settings

We're also aiming at two other big things for our next release apart from "stability":

* Moderation queues and flagging
* Initial Client App API (Mastodon-compatible)

The goal will be for our next release to be the first one we can *recommend that*
*a small community can be run on*. This is a relatively high bar for us, and while we
will still have a lot of work to do afterwards (especially around accessibility and
internationalisation), it's a milestone we're excited to reach.
