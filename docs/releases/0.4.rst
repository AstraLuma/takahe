Upgrade Notes
-------------

Settings
~~~~~~~~

The settings system has changed, and affected some of our environment variable
names.

* ``PGHOST``, ``PGUSER`` and similar are still supported, but a new
  ``TAKAHE_DATABASE_SERVER`` env var is now the recommended way to
  configure - it takes a URI/DSN.

* ``TAKAHE_EMAIL_HOST`` and ``TAKAHE_SENDGRID_API_KEY`` have been removed, and
  replaced with ``TAKAHE_EMAIL_SERVER``, that takes ``smtp://`` or ``sendgrid://`` URIs.

* ``TAKAHE_MEDIA_BACKEND`` now expects a URI starting with ``s3://`` or ``gcs://``.

You can see updated instructions of how to set all of these in :doc:`/installation`.


Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There is one new database migration - it is backwards-compatible,
so apply the migration *before* you update your webserver and stator deployments.


Stator
~~~~~~

If you have low traffic, you may now run Stator via periodic fetch of a URL
rather than a continuous background process. See :doc:`/installation` for more.
